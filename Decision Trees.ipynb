    "\n",
    "Attribute selection measure is a heuristic for selecting the splitting criterion that partition data into the best possible manner. It is also known as splitting rules because it helps us to determine breakpoints for tuples on a given node. ASM provides a rank to each feature(or attribute) by explaining the given dataset. Best score attribute will be selected as a splitting attribute. In the case of a continuous-valued attribute, split points for branches also need to define. Most popular selection measures are Information Gain, Gain Ratio, and Gini Index.\n",

    "\n",
    "Example, let’s say we only have two classes , a positive class and a negative class. Therefore ‘i’ here could be either + or (-). So if we had a total of 100 data points in our dataset with 30 belonging to the positive class and 70 belonging to the negative class then ‘P+’ would be 3/10 and ‘P-’ would be 7/10. Pretty straightforward.\n",

    "0.88 is considered a high entropy , a high level of disorder ( meaning low level of purity). Entropy is measured between 0 and 1.(Depending on the number of classes in your dataset, entropy can be greater than 1 but it means the same thing , a very high level of disorder.)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Does it matter why entropy is measured using log base 2 or why entropy is measured between 0 and 1 and not some other range? No. It’s just a metric. It’s not important to know how it came to be. It’s important to know how to read it and what it tells us, which we just did above. Entropy is a measure of disorder or uncertainty and the goal of machine learning models and Data Scientists in general is to reduce uncertainty.\n",

    "__1. Information Gain__:Shannon invented the concept of entropy, which measures the impurity of the input set. In physics and mathematics, entropy referred as the randomness or the impurity in the system. In information theory, it refers to the impurity in a group of examples. Information gain is the decrease in entropy. Information gain computes the difference between entropy before split and average entropy after split of the dataset based on given attribute values. ID3 (Iterative Dichotomiser) decision tree algorithm uses information gain.\n",

For instance, consider an attribute with a unique identifier such as customer_ID has zero info(D) because of pure partition. This maximizes the information gain and creates useless partitioning.\n",
    "\n",
    "C4.5, an improvement of ID3, uses an extension to information gain known as the gain ratio. Gain ratio handles the issue of bias by normalizing the information gain using Split Info. Java implementation of the C4.5 algorithm is known as J48, which is available in WEKA data mining tool.\n",
