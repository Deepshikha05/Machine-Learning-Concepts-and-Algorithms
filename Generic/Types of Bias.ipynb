This bias can arise because people tend to focus on documenting circumstances that are unusual or especially memorable, assuming that the ordinary can \"go without saying.\""

    "EXAMPLE: A sentiment-analysis model is trained to predict whether book reviews are positive or negative based on a corpus of user submissions to a popular website. The majority of reviews in the training data set reflect extreme opinions (reviewers who either loved or hated a book), because people were less likely to submit a review of a book if they did not respond to it strongly. As a result, the model is less able to correctly predict sentiment of reviews that use more subtle language to describe a book."

Consumers who bought the competing product were 80% more likely to refuse to complete the survey, and their data was underrepresented in the sample.\n",

Instead of randomly targeting consumers, the surveyer chose the first 200 consumers that responded to an email, who might have been more enthusiastic about the product than average purchasers."

In some cases, a model builder may actually keep training a model until it produces a result that aligns with their original hypothesis; this is called experimenter's bias.\n",

The engineer had an unpleasant encounter with a hyperactive toy poodle as a child, and ever since has associated the breed with aggression. When the trained model predicted most toy poodles to be relatively docile, the engineer retrained the model several more times until it produced a result showing smaller poodles to be more violent."
